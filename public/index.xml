      <description>Launching Question  Launching products is one of the most important duties of a PM, so it makes sense that interviewers would ask how you would do this. 
Approach   The Product: Discuss the vision of the product, along with its strengths, weaknesses, and risks. What does the product ultimately hope to achieve? What is its target market? What are the things that would worry you? Who is it competing against and how is it positioned against those?</description>

      <description>Marketing questions are about product positioning, customers, and handling competition.  
Approach:  Understand the Company: What are the company’s goals? What is its mission? What are its strengths and weaknesses? What threatens it? 
 Understand the Competition: Break down the competition into segments. Who competes and in what market?(竞争对手是谁) How do they position themselves? How entrenched are they?(怎么巩固自己的位置) What are their strengths and weaknesses? 
 Understand the Customers: Who are your customers?</description>
