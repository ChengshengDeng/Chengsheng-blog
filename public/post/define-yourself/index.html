<h2>Tell Me a Bit About Yourself </br></h2>

<div id="example-answer" class="section level3">
<h3>Example Answer </br></h3>
<p>Interviewer: Tell me a bit about yourself </br></p>
<p>Candidate : </br></p>
<p>Sure, I’d love to.
I’m currently a PM with MapSign, where I have been for the last two years. </br></p>
<p>I got into product management by accident, but found that I loved working with customers. A lot of people see technology as forcing complexity into their lives, but I don’t think it has to be that way. I like listening to customers, understanding exactly what their issues are, and figuring out how technology can simplify their lives.</br></p>
<p>After I graduated from college, I joined a small startup called MealRight as a software engineer. We were doing okay, but it just didn’t look like we were getting that hockey stick growth that everyone talks about. </br></p>
<p>I knew a bit about the restaurant industry from my family’s restaurant growing up, and I proposed pivoting to focus on giving restaurants more visibility into their suppliers. I talked with a bunch of restaurants to validate this problem, and successfully convinced the team to shift gears. </br></p>
<p>I stepped in as product manager where I stayed for several years, eventually leading a team of four PMs. </br></p>
<p>I’m currently a PM with MapSign, where I manage the personalization features. </br></p>
<p>I recently launched a feature which allows users to create their own maps. This was actually created on a whim for a hackathon I participated in, but it turned out that users really loved this. It allowed them to tell a “story.” Whereas previously people used our product mostly privately, now people were sharing their maps with family and friends. This has resulted in about a 15% increase in paying users. </br></p>
<p>I can go into more detail about my work at MapSign if you’d like. </br></p>
<p>Outside of work, I do a bit of coding for fun, participating in hackathons like the one I just mentioned. I also run a blog focused on the New York City music scene. I manage a team of ten writers—mostly college students, who are happy to write for free. We get about 200,000 visits per month. </br></p>
<p>I’m looking now for a role at an early-stage company where I’ll be able to take a single product from conception through to launch. I think my experience as a developer and as a PM who works cross-functionally will give me the background to work with, and even take on some of the responsibilities of, several other roles. That’s a lot of what interested me in this role; it’s at the perfect time for me to dive in, and it’s so closely related to the personalization work I’m doing right now</p>

                    <p>Launching Question  Launching products is one of the most important duties of a PM, so it makes sense that interviewers would ask how you would do this. 
Approach   The Product: Discuss the vision of the product, along with its strengths, weaknesses, and risks. What does the product ultimately hope to achieve? What is its target market? What are the things that would worry you? Who is it competing against and how is it positioned against those?</p>
