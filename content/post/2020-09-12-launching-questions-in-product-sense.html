<p>Launching Question</p>
<p>Launching products is one of the most important duties of a PM, so it makes sense that interviewers would ask how you would do this.
Approach
The Product: Discuss the vision of the product, along with its strengths, weaknesses, and risks. What does the product ultimately hope to achieve? What is its target market? What are the things that would worry you? Who is it competing against and how is it positioned against those?
Launch Goals: Determine the goals of the launch. Do you want as many users as possible? Do you want to ensure profitability upfront? Do you want to validate that the product meets the market’s needs? Do you want to ensure a positive reaction (even at the expense of slower growth)
Launch Design: Now that you know the goals, determine how you will achieve those. What market would be a good test bed? Will you control growth through an invitation system? Will you roll out just a limited version of the product so you can launch earlier? Will you try to make the biggest possible splash and get as many users as possible
Launch Implementation (Pre + During + Post): With the basic design set, you now need to actually describe how you would implement this design. Break down your approach into three phases: pre-launch tasks, launch tasks, and post-launch tasks. Launching is not just a day-of process.</p>
<p>Your launch implementation discussion should cover the following aspects, possibly for each phase of launch:
Target Market: Will you initially launch for just a particular city or a particular school? What is your initial target market?
User Types / Components: If there are multiple types of users (e.g., drivers and riders), we may launch to these users separately: at different times and in different ways.<br />
MVP or Full Product: Will you launch an early minimum-viable product (MVP), or will you wait until the product is fairly full featured?
Distribution: What stores and sales channels will carry your product? What platforms will you launch on?
Rollout: When will it launch to different types of users? Are you going to start with a private beta? Will invitations be required?
Buzz: How will you build buzz around your product (or will you)? Who will you reach out to? How will you get them on board? What do you want them to say about your product?
Partnerships: Are there any partnerships that will help you to achieve your vision?
Risks: What are the risks of the product, and how can you mitigate them? Are there legal challenges? Do you worry about a backlash from customers about privacy changes?<br />
In thinking about these decisions, it might be useful to think about the Customer Purchase Decision Making Process. Which parts will be the most challenging? How will you overcome that?

Example Question</p>
<p>Imagine you’re building a service to connect people with a recommendations/booking service for local service providers (plumbers, etc.) – like an OpenTable for service providers. How would you launch this product
A candidate could respond with an answer like the following.
Okay, just to get this straight, what I’m imagining is a place where people could search for, say, a plumber or an electrician and see reviews. They could probably request an open time slot (if that’s possible) or post a job and get bids.
When I think about this product, it feeds a clear need. I don’t know of other direct competitors to this
One of the challenges we’ll face – and thus one of the things we’ll need to design our launch around – is that it’s a chicken and egg problem. We have two types of users: service providers and clients. Service providers won’t want to join until there are enough clients, and clients won’t want to join until there are enough service providers.
The other challenge I suspect we’ll face is being top of mind when a user needs a service provider. We’re trying to change user behavior, and that’s always hard.
We want to design our launch to handle these two issues. In fact, given the challenges we’re up against and given the odds that we won’t get things quite right the first time, I think it’s important we launch early with a minimum viable product.
To tackle the first problem, we’ll want to establish a strong user base of service providers first in a focused area (ideally, an affluent area with a lot of homeowners). We’ll do a controlled launch where we can throttle client signup if it gets too high relative to the number of providers.
To tackle the second problem, we’ll need to make ourselves more top of mind. The best way to do this is probably by focusing on services that are more regularly used: housecleaners, drivers, gardeners, pool cleaners, etc.
I think we’ll need to launch, at the minimum, both a web client and mobile client for providers, and one or the other for clients. The providers need both since the mobile client allows them to take bookings on-the-go, and the web will help support providers without phones. For clients, I’d suggest that we start off with a web client. I do think the mobile client is really important, but it requires building for multiple operating systems. Given that we need to get something out ASAP, I think it’s best to just do one for now.
In the months before launch, we’ll start with getting providers signed up. They are less likely to get turned off than clients are by a mismatch in supply or demand for providers.
We’ll pull providers from two places. First, we’ll pull them from review sites such as Yelp and from community blogs and forums. Second, we’ll reach out to real estate agents. They tend to be a go-to place for advice for new homeowners. We want them to know about our product, and we also want their list of recommended providers. An active sales force will be necessary to do this.
For the launch to clients, we’ll do an invite-only, slow launch. We “want to incentivize people to invite their friends though, so we may offer some sort of credit to people who invite their friends.
To build buzz, we’ll also want to engage with the local community. We could have physical signage at popular cafes, reach out to local blogs, use Facebook groups about the community, etc. A lot of areas have their own newspapers, so we could try that too.
“Post-launch, we want to analyze metrics on signups, conversion, etc. One of the things I expect we’ll find is that many people sign up and then forget to use us when an issue comes up. We will need to track this carefully, as this will be a big challenge for us.
It’s not just a numbers game, though: We really need to build a strong relationship with the service providers. We want them to be advocates for the site. If they can encourage existing clients to use it, then those clients may use it for other services, too. We also need their feedback to enable us to perfect the site.
So, to recap, we’re doing the following: We’ll build a mobile and web client for providers, and just a web client for users. We’ll solicit providers through Yelp, community blogs and forums, and real estate agents, paying particular attention to recurring services such as gardeners and cleaners. We’ll launch in a localized community – Silicon Valley is probably a good candidate – getting as many providers signed up as possible. The service will be gradually rolled out to clients with an invite-only registration. We’ll maintain strong relationships with providers and clients and make it a point to excel in customer service. This will ensure we get the feedback we need to refine our product.
